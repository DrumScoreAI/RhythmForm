# RhythmForm

An AI-powered utility to convert PDF drum scores into interactive MusicXML files. RhythmForm uses a transformer-based Optical Music Recognition (OMR) model specialized for percussion notation.

The goal of this project is to provide drummers and musicians with a tool to digitize their legally-owned sheet music for practice, editing, and analysis.

**Disclaimer:** This tool is for use with sheet music that you have the legal right to process. The user is solely responsible for ensuring they are not infringing on any copyrights.

**References:** This work was inspired by the [Sheet Music Transformer](https://github.com/antoniorv6/SMT) project [arXiv article](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12105).

## Features

- 🥁 **Drum-Focused OMR**: A transformer model trained specifically on drum and percussion notation for higher accuracy.
- 📄 **PDF to MusicXML**: Converts multi-page PDF drum scores into standard MusicXML files.
- 🎼 **Interactive Output**: The generated MusicXML can be imported into MuseScore, GarageBand, or any other notation software that supports the format.
- 🤖 **Synthetic Data Pipeline**: Includes a full suite of scripts for generating synthetic training data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PyTorch
- MuseScore Studio (for rendering synthetic data and viewing output)

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DrumScoreAI/RhythmForm.git
cd RhythmForm
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

**(Note: This describes the final intended usage. The model is currently under development.)**

```bash
rhythmform convert "/path/to/my/drum_score.pdf" --output "my_score.xml"
```

This command will:
1. Convert the PDF into a series of images.
2. Use the trained `RhythmForm` model to process each image into a symbolic music representation.
3. Convert the symbolic representation into a valid MusicXML file.
4. Save the file to the specified output path.

## Alternatively, use the pre-built Docker images

Pre-built Docker images are available on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) for different stages of the RhythmForm workflow:

- **`ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-core:latest`**  
  The full package image with all dependencies installed.  
  *No default command is set.*  
  Use this image for interactive exploration, debugging, or running any script manually.  
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-core:latest bash
  ```

- **`ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-synthesizer:latest`**  
  Convenience image for data synthesis.  
  The default command runs the data synthesis pipeline.  
  **Expected volume:** Attach your data directory to `/app/training_data`.  
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v /path/to/training_data:/app/training_data ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-synthesizer:latest
  ```

- **`ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-trainer:latest`**  
  Convenience image for model training.  
  The default command runs the model training pipeline.  
  **Expected volume:** Attach your data directory to `/app/training_data`.  
  Example:
  ```sh
  docker run --rm -v /path/to/training_data:/app/training_data ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-trainer:latest
  ```

- **`ghcr.io/drumscoreai/rhythmform-predictor:latest`**  
  *(Coming soon)*  
  This image will provide a default command for running inference/prediction.

**Note:**  
- All images expect data to be mounted at `/app/training_data` for reading and writing datasets, models, and outputs.
- You can override the default command in any image by specifying your own command after the image name.

## How It Works

RhythmForm uses a three-stage process:

### 1. Data Preparation
A dataset of paired `(image, music_data)` is created. This project includes a powerful synthetic data generator (`scripts/generate_synthetic_score.py`) that creates random but musically plausible drum scores in MusicXML, which are then rendered to PDF/PNG to create a perfectly aligned dataset.

### 2. Model Training
A transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model is trained on the dataset to learn the mapping from score images to a symbolic text (ST) representation.

### 3. Inference and Conversion
- The `convert` command takes a user's PDF.
- It runs the trained model on the PDF images to generate an ST string.
- A separate script parses this ST string and uses the `music21` library to programmatically construct a MusicXML score, which is then saved to a file.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Generate synthetic scores:**  
   `python scripts/generate_synthetic_score.py`
2. **Prepare dataset (convert XML to images, create manifest):**  
   `python scripts/prepare_dataset.py`
3. **Build tokenizer vocabulary:**  
   `python -m scripts.omr_model.tokenizer`
4. **Train the model:**  
   `python -m scripts.omr_model.train`
